This questionnaire allows a resource owner to define the maximum impact that a vulnerability can have.

Impact of violation of Confidentiality / Integrity / Availability can be:
 - High - 1
 - Medium - 0.66
 - Low - 0.3

Questions:

What is the impact of the resource being down for 15 min:
 - Don't care / it can't be taken down / we rely on a 3rd party, for example, a smart contract on the Ethereum platform (Availability impact = 0)
 - Low/medium - (Availability impact = 0.3)
 - High - (Availability impact = 1)

// Optional question, appears if the answer for previous was low/medium:
What is the impact of the resource being down for 3 hours:
 - Low/medium (Availability impact = 0.3)
 - High (Availability impact = 0.66)

What is the impact of the full leak/disclosure of the resource information?
 - None, for example, public blockchain (Confidentiality impact = 0)
 - Low (Confidentiality impact = 0.3)
 - Medium (Confidentiality impact = 0.66)
 - High (Confidentiality impact = 1)

What is the impact of the change to any resource data including all databases?
 - None (Integrity impact = 0)
 - Low (Integrity impact = 0.3)
 - Medium (Integrity impact = 0.66)
 - High (Integrity impact = 1)
