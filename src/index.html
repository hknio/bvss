                    <p class="small">High: A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require the attacker: to perform target-specific reconnaissance; to prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or to inject herself into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g. a man in the middle attack).</p>
